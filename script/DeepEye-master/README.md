# DeepEye
DeepEye: Deep Convolutional Network for Pupil Detection in real Environment

## Requirements:

    Tensorflow 1.13
    OpenCV

## Installing Steps

The Best way to get it working:

Install Conda for python 3, then:

    conda create --name deepeye_env
    conda activate deepeye_env
    conda install tensorflow=1.13.1
    conda install opencv

Then employ this venv to run the example.py 

The best way to use DeepEye with a webcam is using a eye localization algorithm, such as opencv with cascade or using another neural network.
